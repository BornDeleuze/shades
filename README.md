Shades is a rails application that allows users to track their books. 

This application is not currently hosted anywhere, but can be run locally by the rails server.

It's written and run on ruby 2.6.1 and rails 6.1.

To run this program:
Run bundle install
    this makes sure all the gems are up to date and ready
Run rails db:migrate
    this builds the database
Run rails db:seed
    this populates the database with some basic data
Run rails server
    this boots the server so you can access it through your browser
Open the browser and navigate to localhost:3000
    play around with how it works!
